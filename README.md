**Conceptualizing Death: How Individual Differences Influence Belief in the Afterlife**
<br>

Research shows that, despite their glaring contradictions, natural and supernatural explanations for different phenomena are able to coexist within an individual. Interestingly, differences in how these explanations are manifested can be observed both cross-culturally and interpersonally. Religious belief is clearly a highly individualized trait, but what exactly causes such a discernable variance in accounts? In the following study, 114 participants aged 7-38 years old were asked a series of questions about the continuation of human processes after death. These responses were then correlated with various individual difference measures ranging from cognitive style to religiosity. In order to find the best predictors for belief in the afterlife, I computed multiple linear regressions for adults and non-adults. The resulting models indicate an interesting effect of prime and reveal a fundamental difference in how the two age groups embody religious belief.
